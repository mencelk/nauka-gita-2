        <h1>40:1</h1>
        <h3>Sabaton</h3>
        <h5>From album "The Art of War"</h5>
        <p>
            Baptized in fire <br>
            Forty to one
        </p>
        <p>
            So silent before the storm<br>
            Awaiting command<br>
            A few has been chosen to stand<br>
            As one outnumbered by far<br>
            The orders from high command<br>
            Fight back, hold your ground!
        </p>
        <p>
            In early September it came<br>
            A war unknown to the world<br>
            No army may enter that land<br>
            That is protected by polish hand<br>
            Unless you are forty to one<br>
            Your force will soon be undone
        </p>
        <p>
            Baptized in fire<br>
            Forty to one<br>
            Spirit of Spartans<br>
            Death and glory<br>
            Soldiers of Poland<br>
            Second to none<br>
            Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt
        </p>
        <p>
            The 8th of September it starts<br>
            The rage of the Reich<br>
            A barrage of mortars and guns<br>
            Stand past, the bunkers will hold<br>
            The captain has pledged his life<br>
            I'll face my fate here!<br>
            The sound of artillery strike<br>
            So fierce<br>
            The thunder of guns
        </p>
        <p>
            So come, bring on all that you've got<br>
            Come hell, come high water, never stop<br>
            Unless you are forty to one<br>
            Your lives will soon be undone
        </p>
        <p>

            Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt
        </p>
        <p>
            Always remember, a fallen soldier<br>
            Always remember, fathers and sons at war<br>
            Always remember, a fallen soldier<br>
            Always remember, fathers and sons at war<br>
            Always remember, a fallen soldier<br>
            Always remember, buried in history
